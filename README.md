## Keyword extraction

Ongoing research project on Natural Language Processing at INSA Lyon.

We are working on a model able to extract keywords from the StackExchange sites.
It is based on the Kaggle competition ["Identify keywords and tags from millions of text questions"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iii-keyword-extraction)
